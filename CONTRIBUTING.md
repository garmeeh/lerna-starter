Thanks for thinking of contributing ðŸ˜€

**will this be your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

## Project Set Up

1. Fork & Clone repo
2. `$ yarn install` to install your dependencies
3. `$ yarn test` to validate you got it working
4. Create a branch for your work
5. Open a PR

## Making Changes
- Any changes that require the documentation to be updated must have it done
- Unit Tests where possible should be added

## Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the [all contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors)
specification. To add yourself to the contributors list on the README.md, please use
the automated script as part of your PR:

```
yarn contributor <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>
```

Follow the prompt. If you've already added yourself to the list and are making a
new type of contribution, you can run it again and select the added contribution
type. If you need to edit the `.all-contributorsrc` file by hand that's fine
too, just run `yarn contributor:gen` to regenerate the table
